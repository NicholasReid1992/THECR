# CSCI-495-Semester-Project
Senior Seminar Project

A project for UTM INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH's Desiree McCullough.
This Project's aim is to make a program to assist the team in reports 
by the program running queries against the Banner Database.

First goals include:
1.  Recreating a example copy of the banner_db
2.  making an easy way to generate correct queries with the ability to be easily modifiable by the users/staff.

Possible goals include:
3.  Creating a GUI that can make the process even easier to enter, assess, and modify information from the queries.
